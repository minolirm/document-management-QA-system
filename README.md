# üìÇ Document Management & Question Answering (QA) System  

An **AI-powered document management and question answering system** that automates information extraction from **underwriting and legal documents**.  
This platform allows users to upload documents and interactively **ask questions in natural language**, replacing repetitive manual reviews with an **intelligent API-based solution**.  

---

## üìå Background & Problem  
Real estate agencies process **large volumes of underwriting and legal documents** every day.  
- Manual review is **slow, error-prone, and inconsistent**.  
- Key details (e.g., tenant name, lease duration, mortgage value, client obligations) are buried in lengthy text.  
- Traditional tools lacked the ability to provide **direct, contextual answers** to user queries.  

This created a need for an **automated Question Answering (QA) solution** that could:  
- Extract and structure information from unstructured documents.  
- Allow interactive Q&A over contracts and reports.  
- Reduce manual workload while improving compliance reliability.  

---

## üéØ Objectives  
- Enable **document-level Q&A** using natural language queries.  
- Automate information extraction from PDFs, excel sheets, and scanned contracts.  
- Provide a **Flask-based API** for seamless system integration.  
- Store results securely for traceability and compliance.  
- Reduce reliance on manual document review.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Approach  
1. **Document Ingestion & OCR**  
   - Used **Apache Tika** to extract raw text from PDFs and scanned documents. 

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Standardized and cleaned extracted text for downstream NLP tasks.  

3. **Question Answering with LLMs**  
   - Integrated **GPT-3.5** for contextual understanding and answers.  
   - Used **TAPAS** for table-based Q&A (structured data queries).  

4. **Interactive API Layer**  
   - Built with **Flask**, supporting endpoints for:  
     - Document upload  
     - Q&A queries  
     - Structured JSON responses  

5. **Database & Logging**  
   - Implemented **Firebase** to store documents, answers, and logs.  
   - Enabled audit trails for compliance checks.
